# ChessGameVs.AI
C program that allows you to play chess against an AI (roughly 1000 elo). There is full rule enforcement and contains all the same rules as normal chess would. The AI was created in C with Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and full rule enforcement.
I have been working on this project for a couple of months now and I am incredibly proud of what I have been able to accomplish. Combining both my hobbies and my area of study has allowed me to further my skills in both areas of chess and programming/AI. While this project was very difficult, I am glad I stuck with it because now I have gained further experience with creating AI and how AI truly works.
you can run this program in an online C compiler or a local one. Simply copy and paste the code into the compiler and it should run like a charm. 
I plan to make the AI a stronger chess opponent with much higher ELO rating. If you have any questions you can contact me at willdjakaria@gmail.com
